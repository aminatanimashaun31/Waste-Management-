    <H1>OUR SERVICES</H1>
    <h2>Collection of Plastics.</h2>
    <P>Foremost among our comprehensive list of services is the collection of plastic bottles from individuals, corporates and municipal areas through our collection 
        schemes. We have two innovative schemes which makes it easy to generate these bottles on a large scale for processing. We have the individual collector schemes
        as well as the collection centre scheme. The individual house-to-house scheme is an arrangement whereby individuals, families and organisations who have a collectible of plastics
        reach out to us on our hotlines, to deliver a pick-up service. This eliminates stress on the part of collectors as they do not have to move to our collection centres.
        In the collection centre scheme, collectors and aggregators move the plastics from their base to the our various collection centres located across the country. In the two schemes, the collectors are paid a fee based on the weights of botteles supplied, however collectors under the collection centre schemes enjoy an additional payment in lieu
        of the cost of transporting the items to the collection centres. Usually, large industries who generate plastics on a large scale are those who participate in the collection centre scheme.  </P>

    <h2>Recycling the Recyclables</h2>
    <p>After the collection stage, we move to the second stage which is the stage of sorting the plastic from other materials. This is done at the material recovery facility, Afterwards, the materials 
        are moved to the plastic recovery facility (PRF) for further sorting into different types of plastic. We later move the materials to the processor which includes optical sorting machines and sink float operators that
        that separate plastics by thickness, colour, size and plastic types. Furthermore, we run plastics through magnets to remove any metal that may have not been removed from the previous stages.
        The next stage involves the cleaning and washing of the plastics. This is to ensure the removal of adhesives, residual waste left in the containers, food waste and labels. It is important that these are 
        removed and the materials are as clean as possible as it can affect the quality of the recyclates. The final two stages ar the shredding and extrusion stages. The plastics are shredded into smaller pieces 
        with the aid of shredding machines. Finally, the shredded plastics are melted and extruded into new pellets. We usually sell pellets to manufacturers, but in rare occasions, we keep some special plastic types 
        for in-house refabrication of items for sale.</p>

<h2>Research and Consultancy</h2>
<p> Research is a huge part of our operation. We partner with research departments of higher instititions of learning within the country to carry out research on best practises in the plastic recycling industries. 
    We equally work with students during their undergraduate SIWES programme and final year research projects. Our research lab has served as a home to many intellectuals and professionals interested in the science of 
    recycling plastic bottles. We have received fundings and sponsorships for some of our research projects from the International Body of Plastic and Polythene Recycling, India chapter; National Research Body of the 
    State Government. We have provided consultation services to Governments, NGOs and individual professionals in our years of operation.

<h2>Educative and Sensitization Schemes</h2>
<p>We have conducted over seventy training and awareness programs on issues relating to plastic waste management across Nigeria. We have also organised various social awarenessprograms on plastic waste management 
    at NGOs, companies, schools, hospitals, societies, public ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs). We take great care to organise training sessions to train our collection centre staff to sort plastics in the manner by which it can be recycled 
    hassle-free. We organise a monthly save-your-plastic initiative to create awareness about responsible and sustainable plastic use in the country.

<h2>Sale of Recycled Items</h2>
<p>In some rare ocassions, we preserve some special plastic items to recreate usable items for homes and organistions. They are usually used to make vintage items for sale at national and international exhibition centres. We use this to raise funds for
     awareness on recycling projects and to reassure the world that truly plastics can be recycled for use. Some companies, as part of their corporate social responsibilities bid and buy these items at higer prices than quoted. Individuals and families that are interested in 
    responsible resource usage also do this. </p>
