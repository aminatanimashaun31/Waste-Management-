    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
    GOCLEAN WASTE MANAGEMENT Co… promoting cleanliness across the nation.

GoClean is Nigeria’s foremost waste recycling and social benefit venture that
motivates post consumers to recycle by creating value from their everyday waste.
We have developed an incentive based scheme, which involves collecting recyclable plastic
bottles from post consumers, and in turn rewards them with “Points” which they can accumulate
and use to redeem household items offered through our GoClean store or cash.
We operate on a drop off and door to door collection of recyclable plastic bottles.

<h2>VISION</h2>
To uphold our position as Nigeria’s foremost and most reliable waste collection and recycling
company.

<h2>MISSION</h2> 
Our mission is to make Nigeria the cleanest and least polluted nation in Africa and the world at
large.
